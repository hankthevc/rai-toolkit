## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Talking Points

When presenting this project to AI companies:

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"I built a governance-as-code toolkit because I saw AI teams struggling to make risk decisions that were both fast AND auditable. The core insight is treating safeguards as versioned dataâ€”YAML policy packs validated with JSON Schemaâ€”instead of buried in spreadsheets. I deployed it as a Streamlit app, validated it against three realistic scenarios, and achieved 85% test coverage to demonstrate production-grade governance tooling."*

### Technical Deep Dive (if asked)
- **Architecture:** YAML policy packs + Pydantic models + Jinja2 templates
- **Risk Scoring:** Transparent additive heuristic (explainable in interviews)
- **Framework Alignment:** NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO 42001, OWASP, MITRE ATLAS, U.S. OMB
- **Test Strategy:** Parametrized tests, edge case coverage, CI enforcement
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud (free), Docker, Heroku, AWS options documented

### Case Study Highlights
- **Healthcare chatbot:** Critical tier (12 points), 15 controls â†’ shows defense-in-depth
- **Internal copilot:** Low tier (0 points), 0 controls â†’ shows appropriate de-escalation
- **Hiring AI:** Critical tier (9 points), identified policy gaps â†’ shows iterative improvement

### Impact Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** 85%+ (industry standard for regulated software)
- **Case Studies:** 3 spanning full risk spectrum (Critical â†’ Low)
- **Analytics:** 8 visualizations for governance metrics
- **Documentation:** 15 pages including deployment guides and blog post

## ðŸ”® Roadmap Teaser (v0.2)

Based on case study analysis, next priorities are:

1. **Add "Fairness" modifier** (+2 weight)
   - Triggers disparate impact testing
   - GDPR Article 22 explainability
   - Third-party bias audits

2. **Create Employment sector** (+1 weight)
   - EEOC compliance controls
   - Employment-specific policy pack

3. **Improve `when` clause syntax**
   - Support OR conditions
   - Threshold ranges (e.g., `score_above: 10`)

4. **Quantitative calibration**
   - Replace fixed weights with data-driven scoring
   - Requires production telemetry
