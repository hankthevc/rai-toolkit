# EU AI Act Crosswalk (Illustrative)

**Key Judgments**
- Provides a conversational bridge between Project 1 safeguards and the EU AI Act risk categories.
- Emphasizes obligations common to "high-risk" systems such as documentation, human oversight, and incident reporting.
- Not legal advice; coordinate with EU counsel before using for compliance attestations.

## Mapping Overview

| EU AI Act Theme | Example Safeguard | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk Management System | Additive scoring with escalation thresholds | Demonstrates consistent triage but requires documented governance. |
| Data Governance | PII handling controls | Scenario flags enforce privacy reviews and data minimization evidence. |
| Technical Documentation | Decision Record export | Markdown output supports Article 11 documentation expectations. |
| Human Oversight | Human-in-the-loop checkpoints | High/Critical tiers require human review before deployment. |

## Usage Notes
- Use during regulatory watch reviews to communicate coverage gaps.
- Extend with article-level citations once counsel validates interpretations.
- Keep acknowledgments of illustrative status intact in derivative materials.
