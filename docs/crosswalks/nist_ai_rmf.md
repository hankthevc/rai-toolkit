# NIST AI RMF Crosswalk (Illustrative)

**Key Judgments**
- Aligns Project 1 safeguards with the NIST AI RMF Core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.
- Highlights which controls from the policy packs are intended to satisfy each function for interviews and tabletop reviews.
- Illustrative onlyâ€”confirm requirements with legal, privacy, and risk leadership before treating as binding.

## Mapping Overview

| NIST Function | Example Safeguard | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Govern | Accountability owner assigned | Decision Record captures owner/approver to evidence governance oversight. |
| Map | Scenario intake with sector/modifiers | Intake form documents context needed for risk profiling. |
| Measure | Logging and monitoring control | YAML packs flag audit logging for high-risk launches. |
| Manage | Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes autonomy | High tier triggers human review checkpoints. |

## Usage Notes
- Use this table when briefing stakeholders familiar with NIST AI RMF terminology.
- Update alongside any policy pack change; commit history should trace rationale.
- Treat as a communication aid rather than a full compliance mapping until validated.
