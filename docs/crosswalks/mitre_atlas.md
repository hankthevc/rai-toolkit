# MITRE ATLAS Crosswalk (Illustrative)

**Key Judgments**
- Maps Project 1 safeguards to MITRE ATLAS tactics for tracking adversarial AI threats.
- Emphasizes detection and response controls relevant to state-aligned or well-resourced adversaries.
- Illustrative onlyâ€”security operations centers must tailor mappings to their threat models.

## Mapping Overview

| MITRE ATLAS Tactic | Example Safeguard | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TA0001 Reconnaissance | Inventory and registration control | Keeps asset inventory updated to detect enumeration attempts. |
| TA0004 Manipulation | Adversarial testing requirement | Encourages pre-deployment red teaming for high-risk launches. |
| TA0006 Exfiltration | Logging and monitoring | Provides telemetry for detecting data theft or model extraction. |
| TA0007 Impact | Kill-switch / human override | High tier enforces human approval before production changes. |

## Usage Notes
- Share with threat intelligence partners to align governance activities with ATLAS taxonomy.
- Update when new tactics or case studies are published by MITRE.
- Preserve the illustrative disclaimer when presenting to external reviewers.
