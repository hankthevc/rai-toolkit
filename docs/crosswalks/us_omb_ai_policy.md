# U.S. OMB AI Policy Crosswalk (Illustrative)

**Key Judgments**
- Connects Project 1 governance signals to the OMB memorandum on managing federal AI risks (e.g., M-24-10).
- Focuses on inventory, impact assessments, and lifecycle oversight expectations in federal contexts.
- Illustrative onlyâ€”federal agencies must route through official compliance officers before adoption.

## Mapping Overview

| OMB Expectation | Example Safeguard | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI use-case inventory | Scenario intake + Decision Record | Provides documentation suitable for inventory updates. |
| Impact assessments | Risk scoring heuristic | Supports pre-deployment risk assessments and escalation pathways. |
| Ongoing monitoring | Logging/audit control | Encourages continuous evaluation of deployed systems. |
| Senior accountability | Approver field in Decision Record | Aligns with requirement for designated responsible officials. |

## Usage Notes
- Use when briefing public-sector stakeholders exploring governance-as-code prototypes.
- Tailor language and references once agency-specific guidance is published.
- Maintain explicit disclaimers about the illustrative status to avoid misinterpretation.
