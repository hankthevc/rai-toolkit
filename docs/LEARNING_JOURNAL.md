# Learning Journal

## PR1 — Repository Bootstrap
- Professional scaffolding (security, conduct, contribution) sets expectations before code is written.
- Early CI wiring reduces integration risk once policy logic lands.
- Writing executive-ready documentation upfront keeps tone consistent with governance stakeholders.
- Requirements pinning streamlines reproducible local environments and future Streamlit deployments.

## PR2 — Core Libraries
- Policy packs as YAML plus JSON Schema keeps guardrails versionable without code edits.
- Pydantic models ensure governance controls fail fast when metadata is malformed.
- A transparent additive risk engine is easier to justify in interviews than opaque scoring.
- Markdown export templating provides reusable audit trails for both UI and CLI clients.

## PR3 — Streamlit UI
- Centering the entire workflow in a single form submit keeps the decision record immutable once generated.
- Caching policy packs at load time balances UX speed with governance traceability.
- Surfacing authority and clause fields first helps executives tie safeguards back to recognizable frameworks.
- Download buttons beat copy-paste for audit trails—especially when exporting to Markdown for ticketing systems.

## PR4 — Documentation Expansion
- Expanding the root README with workflow context helps stakeholders orient quickly without diving into code.
- Writing a file-by-file primer in plain language clarifies repo structure for junior contributors and interviewers alike.
- Reinforcing safety boundaries across docs keeps responsible-use messaging consistent with governance expectations.

## PR5 — Methodology & Crosswalks
- Documenting the scoring math in prose and tables makes the heuristic defensible during executive briefings.
- Separating framework crosswalks into lightweight stubs keeps regulatory narratives ready without overpromising compliance.
- Versioning guidance needs to live near the policy packs so future contributors understand why Git tags matter for governance.
- Framing false-positive trade-offs explicitly signals to reviewers that the team biases toward safety and escalation.
