# UX Improvements ‚Äî October 9, 2025

## Overview
Simplified the user experience by removing manual API key management and making Interview Mode the default flow for all users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Personal Branding
**Before:**
- "Built by Henry Appel"
- "My reasoning approach"
- "Goal: demonstrate judgment"

**After:**
- "Demonstration prototype showing one potential approach"
- "Sample/demonstrative use only"
- Neutral, educational framing
- Emphasis on governance-as-code patterns, not personal portfolio

### 2. Streamlined API Key Handling
**Before:**
- Users had to manually enter API key OR set environment variable
- Two-button choice: "Interview Mode (Recommended)" vs "Quick Analysis"
- Multiple info messages about where API key came from

**After:**
- API key automatically loaded from Streamlit Cloud secrets
- Single "üîç Analyze AI Use Case" button
- Interview Mode is now the ONLY flow (automatically asks clarifying questions)
- Clean UX with no API key management burden on users

### 3. Benefits
‚úÖ **Simpler onboarding:** Users don't need to manage API keys  
‚úÖ **Better analysis:** Everyone gets the multi-turn interview (more context = better risk assessment)  
‚úÖ **More professional:** No personal branding, focus on demonstrating governance patterns  
‚úÖ **Educational focus:** Clear disclaimers that this is a sample/demonstrative tool  

## Files Modified
- `/project1_risk_framework/app.py` ‚Äî Removed API key input, unified to interview mode only

## Developer Notes

- All Q&A chat features still work seamlessly with same API key source
