# RAI Toolkit Project - Comprehensive Status Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Advanced implementation complete, final troubleshooting in progress

---

## Project Overview & Goals

The **RAI Toolkit** (Responsible AI Toolkit) is a governance-as-code demonstration project designed to showcase comprehensive AI risk assessment capabilities for hiring managers, recruiters, and technical interviewers. Built by Henry Appel, a former White House NSC policy advisor and current AI security researcher at 2430 Group, the project translates AI governance frameworks into executable Python code.

### Core Objectives

1. **Demonstrate AI governance expertise** across multiple domains: ML/AI security (MITRE ATLAS, OWASP LLM Top 10), privacy law (GDPR), regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, export controls), supply chain security, civil rights, and AI safety
2. **Show vibecoding capability** - the entire project was built using AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor), demonstrating rapid prototyping and experimental mindset
3. **Create working governance-as-code** - not just documentation, but executable risk assessment with policy pack matching
4. **Meta-governance demonstration** - use AI to assess AI systems, showing practical understanding of the technology
5. **Position for senior governance roles** - demonstrate breadth spanning security, policy, engineering, and executive operations

### Target Roles

- AI Security / Red Team Lead
- Threat Intelligence & Investigations (nation-state, disinfo, IP theft)
- Responsible / Trustworthy AI Program Manager
- Executive Operations / Chief of Staff (tech & national security)

## What Has Been Achieved

### Phase 1: Core Risk Assessment Framework (Complete)

**Original 6 risk factors:**
- PII/sensitive data processing
- Customer-facing exposure
- High-stakes outcomes (safety, rights, finances)
- Autonomy level (0-3 scale)
- Sector classification
- Risk modifiers (Bio, Cyber, Disinformation, Children)

**Infrastructure:**
- Transparent additive risk scoring engine (`common/utils/risk_engine.py`)
- YAML-encoded policy packs from 6 frameworks (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO 42001, OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS, US OMB AI Policy)
- Conditional policy matching based on risk tier and scenario attributes
- Exportable Decision Records (Markdown format)
- Streamlit web interface with form-based intake
- Full test coverage (pytest) with CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**Documentation:**
- 3 detailed case studies (healthcare chatbot, code copilot, hiring platform)
- 6 framework crosswalk documents
- Educational file overview for early-career developers
- Methodology deep-dive explaining scoring rationale

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Scenario Parsing (Complete)

**OpenAI API integration:**
- Uses GPT-4o with structured outputs (Pydantic models)
- Analyzes plain-language descriptions against governance frameworks
- Provides AI reasoning for transparency (human-in-the-loop design)
- Auto-fills form with suggested risk values
- System prompt engineered for consistent risk assessment (temperature 0.3)

**User experience:**
- Prompt writing tips with 3 detailed examples directly in UI
- "Good" vs "Too vague" anti-patterns
- API key support via Streamlit Cloud secrets OR manual entry
- Feedback showing which API key source is being used

**AI analysis outputs:**
- Estimated risk tier with reasoning
- 3-5 key risk factors specific to scenario
- 5-7 recommended safeguards with framework citations
- Framework alignment analysis (which standards apply and why)
- Side-by-side comparison: AI assessment vs traditional risk engine

### Phase 3: 10 Advanced Risk Factors Expansion (Complete)

**Comprehensive risk assessment now covers 16 dimensions:**

**Technical AI/ML Risks (3 new factors):**
1. **Model architecture type** - LLM, Computer Vision, Multimodal, Reinforcement Learning (determines OWASP vs MITRE threat model)
2. **Training data provenance** - Proprietary, Internet-scraped, User-generated, Third-party, Synthetic (copyright, bias, poisoning risks)
3. **Real-time learning** - Boolean flag for online learning (drift, poisoning, reproducibility loss)

**Privacy & Data Governance (2 new factors):**
4. **Cross-border data transfers** - International data flows (GDPR adequacy, Schrems II, data sovereignty)
5. **Explainability level** - Inherently Interpretable to Black Box (GDPR Art. 22, EU AI Act Art. 13 compliance)

**Supply Chain & Dependencies (1 new factor):**
6. **Foundation model usage** - No Third-Party, Self-hosted, External API (OpenAI/Anthropic), Hybrid (data leakage risks)

**Content & Misuse Risks (2 new factors):**
7. **Synthetic content generation** - Deepfakes, C2PA provenance, EU AI Act Art. 52 transparency
8. **Dual-use risk** - None/Low/Moderate/High (export controls, weaponization potential)

**Rights & Equity (2 new factors):**
9. **Decision reversibility** - Fully Reversible to Irreversible (appeals process, right to review)
10. **Protected populations** - 8 vulnerable groups (Elderly, disabilities, immigrants, incarcerated, healthcare vulnerable, etc.)

**Implementation details:**
- 8 new weight dictionaries in risk scoring engine
- Extended ScenarioContext for policy matching on new factors
- Enhanced AI parser with 20+ field definitions in system prompt
- Streamlit form organized into 5 collapsible sections for advanced factors
- New policy pack: `extended_risk_factors.yaml` with 10 framework-aligned controls
- All tests passing (30/30 in risk_engine, 7/7 in ai_parser)

**Policy controls leveraging new factors:**
- OWASP-LLM01-EXTENDED: Prompt injection defense (triggers on LLM model type)
- DATA-PROV-001: Internet-scraped data governance (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001)
- ONLINE-LEARN-001: Real-time learning monitoring (MITRE ATLAS AML.T0018)
- GDPR-INTL-001: Cross-border data transfer safeguards (GDPR Art. 44-50)
- EXPLAIN-001: Black box model explainability (EU AI Act Art. 13)
- SUPPLY-CHAIN-001: External API data leakage prevention
- SYNTHETIC-001: Synthetic content provenance & watermarking (C2PA, EU AI Act Art. 52)
- DUAL-USE-001: Export controls for weaponizable AI (EAR)
- REVERSIBILITY-001: Irreversible decision human oversight
- PROTECT-POP-001: Vulnerable population enhanced safeguards

## Current Troubleshooting Status

### Issue: AI Analysis Not Displaying Results

**Problem:** OpenAI API successfully authenticates and returns a response, but the parsed `ScenarioAnalysis` object is missing the new analysis fields (`estimated_risk_tier`, `key_risk_factors`, `recommended_safeguards`, `framework_alignment`).

**Diagnosis via debug logging:**
```
DEBUG - Has estimated_risk_tier? False
```

This indicates that OpenAI is returning a `ScenarioAnalysis` object, but **without** the 4 new analytical output fields we added in Phase 2.

**Root cause identified:** 
- **gpt-4o-mini** (originally selected for cost efficiency) cannot reliably handle the complex Pydantic schema with 20+ fields
- The model returns the object but omits fields it can't confidently populate
- This is a known limitation of mini models with complex structured outputs

**Solution implemented (just pushed):**
- Switched from `gpt-4o-mini` to **gpt-4o** which has much better structured output support
- Cost increase is minimal (~$0.01 vs $0.001 per analysis) but worth it for comprehensive governance insights
- Commit: `21a057d` - "Switch to gpt-4o for better structured output support"

**Additional fixes applied during troubleshooting:**

1. **API key handling** - Fixed to properly read from Streamlit Cloud secrets (`st.secrets`) not just `os.getenv()`
2. **Backward compatibility** - Added `hasattr()` checks to handle cached session state from old model schemas
3. **Default values** - Added defaults to all new AI analysis fields to prevent validation errors
4. **Indentation fix** - Moved all code accessing new attributes inside `else` block to prevent AttributeError
5. **Debug logging** - Added comprehensive output showing object structure and field presence

**Current deployment status:**
- All fixes pushed to GitHub: `origin/main`
- Streamlit Cloud auto-deploying (takes ~2 minutes)
- Debug output will remain temporarily to verify gpt-4o returns all fields

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing Phase)

1. **Verify gpt-4o fix** - After Streamlit redeploys (~2 min), test AI analysis
   - Should see: `DEBUG - Has estimated_risk_tier? True`
   - AI reasoning, risk factors, safeguards, framework alignment should all display
   - Form should auto-fill with all 16 risk dimensions

2. **Remove debug output** - Once verified working, clean up debug logging for production

3. **Test complete workflow:**
   - AI analysis → form auto-fill → submit → compare AI vs traditional engine
   - Verify all 16 risk factors contribute to scoring
   - Confirm extended policy pack controls trigger appropriately
   - Download Decision Record and verify it includes new factors

### Short-term Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Screenshot/GIF for README** - Capture the AI analysis in action for portfolio visibility

2. **Add "About Henry" to README** - Professional bio block (already drafted in notes)

3. **Pin repository on GitHub profile** - Increase visibility to recruiters

4. **Create case study #4** - Demonstrate all 16 risk factors with a complex scenario (e.g., "Customer-facing LLM using OpenAI API for financial advice with elderly users")

5. **Performance optimization** - Cache policy pack loading, optimize AI prompt for faster responses

### Medium-term Improvements (If Continuing Project)

1. **Multi-model comparison** - Allow users to compare GPT-4o vs Claude vs Gemini risk assessments

2. **Policy pack generation** - Use AI to help draft new safeguards from regulatory text

3. **Enhanced analytics** - Track which AI suggestions users override most often, refine prompts

4. **Export improvements** - Include AI analysis reasoning in Decision Record markdown

5. **Adversarial testing module** - Use AI to generate edge cases for the risk engine

6. **WhenClause extensions** - Update policy pack schema to support matching on all 16 risk factors (currently only some are matchable)
