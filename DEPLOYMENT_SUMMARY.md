## üìã Manual Steps Required

### **1. Commit & Push Changes**

The terminal is stuck, so you'll need to commit manually:

```bash
cd /Users/HenryAppel/rai-toolkit-1

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "feat: Add comprehensive UX improvements, testing, and documentation

App Enhancements:
- Add framing panel explaining scope, limitations, and goals
- Add governance standards badges (NIST, EU AI Act, OWASP, etc.)
- Add Owners & Next Steps section with context-aware recommendations
- Add Data Handling privacy sidebar
- Replace AI vs traditional comparison with unified narrative assessment
- Enhance Governance Summary with sector-specific considerations

Documentation:
- Add 8 stop-ship rules with detailed requirements in methodology
- Add comprehensive scoring table with 16 risk factors and examples
- Create sample decision record for healthcare chatbot scenario
- Update README with testing section (63 tests, 88% coverage)
- Add Streamlit wake-up notice for cloud deployments

Testing:
- Add 6 new edge case tests for scoring, YAML integrity, and exports
- All 69 tests passing (63 + 6 new)

This represents the final polish for portfolio presentation."

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### **2. Optional: Take Screenshots for README**

If desired, capture 2 screenshots:

**Screenshot 1: AI Analysis in Action**
- Visit https://rai-toolkit.streamlit.app/
- Paste the healthcare chatbot example
- Click "Analyze with AI"
- Capture the AI assessment with risk tier, reasoning, and safeguards
- Save as `docs/images/ai-analysis-demo.png`

**Screenshot 2: Decision Record Output**
- Continue from above, submit the form
- Capture the standards badges + safeguards + next steps sections
- Save as `docs/images/decision-record-output.png`

Then add to README after line 10:
```markdown
## Screenshots

```

### **3. Verify Deployment**

After pushing:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Streamlit Cloud to redeploy
2. Visit https://rai-toolkit.streamlit.app/
3. Test the framing panel (top expander)
4. Run an AI analysis
5. Submit and verify standards badges appear
6. Check Owners & Next Steps section
7. Verify sidebar shows Data Handling info

### **4. Test Suite Verification**

Run locally to confirm all tests pass:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
# Should show: 69 passed (63 original + 6 new edge cases)

python3 -m pytest tests/test_edge_cases.py -v
# Should show: 6 passed
```
