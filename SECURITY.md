# Security Policy

## Key Judgments
- This toolkit prioritizes defensive, governance-focused analysis. It does not expose or encourage offensive techniques.
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately so fixes can be prepared before public disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Email security issues to <security@example.com> with the subject line `RAI-Toolkit Vulnerability Report`.

Please include:
- Description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (if available)
- Suggested mitigations or references
- Your contact information for follow-up

We aim to acknowledge new reports within five business days and share remediation timelines within ten business days.

## Disclosure Expectations
- Please do not create public issues for security findings until a fix is released.
- Avoid tests that could degrade availability or compromise user data.
- We will credit reporters in release notes upon request.
